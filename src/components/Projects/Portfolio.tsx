                <p>This is the first website I’ve ever properly hosted and bought a domain for. Before this, I had only built a basic web app for Lunge, but never a full website from start to finish.</p>                                    
                <p>I built this portfolio as a way to track and share my personal growth as a developer — not just the final results, but the learning process behind each project. It’s meant to be a space where I can reflect on how far I’ve come, document what I’m currently working on, and keep a public record of my evolving skills over time. I hope it also gives others a transparent look into the ups and downs of learning to build real software, from early experiments to more polished work.</p>
                <p>I’m constantly updating the site as I learn new technologies, design patterns, and animation techniques — treating it as both a portfolio and a canvas. My goal is to eventually shape it into one of those beautifully crafted, highly interactive sites with smooth, fluid animations and a sharp, modern aesthetic — the kind of experience that’s as inspiring to explore as it is to build.</p>
