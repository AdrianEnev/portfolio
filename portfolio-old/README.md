```

## 🔧 Configuration

Environment variables are configured in your Netlify Site settings (do not expose these in the public Vite env):

```env
# Email provider
EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses

# SES SMTP
SES_SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
SES_SMTP_PORT=587
SES_SMTP_USER=your_ses_smtp_username
SES_SMTP_PASS=your_ses_smtp_password

# Routing
EMAIL_FROM=portfolio@adrianenev.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=adrianenev.com
EMAIL_TO=you@yourdomain.com

# CORS / Origin
APP_BASE_URL=https://adrianenev.com
```

Notes:
- Make sure your SES domain and From address are verified, and your account is out of sandbox or the To address is verified.
- Do NOT prefix these with `VITE_`—they must remain server-only.

## 🧪 Local development for functions

To test the Netlify Function locally with the frontend, use Netlify CLI (optional):

```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli
netlify dev
```

This runs the Vite dev server and proxies `/.netlify/functions/*` to local functions.
